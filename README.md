# About Me


## In the beginning...

Hello! My name is Kyle Winckler. I was born on a frigid, snowy morning sometime
ago in the midwestern state of South Dakota. I spent most of my formative years
in South Dakota, but also spent a little bit of time in southeastern Texas. I
spent most of my formative years skateboarding. I would often skate for *at*
*least* four hours a day, as long as the weather allowed it, and sometimes, even
when it didn't.

## Moving to Seattle

In 2010, my friends decided to move to Seattle and asked my girlfriend and I
if we would like to come along for the ride. As we were still living in South
Dakota, this was an easy decision. With no jobs lined up or any savings to rely
on, we packed up all of our stuff and drove across the country. We didn't even
have a place to live until the day before we arrived! It was scary and exciting
at the same time.

## Staying in Seattle

The moderate weather, progressive attitude, and plethora of beautiful nature
surrounding Seattle definately made the transition to a new place easier.
It didn't take very long before we realized that Seattle was truly where we felt
at home. As the cost of living as increased so dramatically in the last few
years, we have realized that to stay in the city we will have to change to more
lucrative careers. Luckily for me, I stumbled across CodeFellows in February of
2015 while I was working on a computer science transfer degree from North
Seattle College. I hope to work as a software developer in Seattle upon
completion of the program for many years to come!

### Bonus

One of my good friends from back home competed on American Ninja Warrior this
year. Here is a link to his __amazing__ submission video (especially if you
like the movie Footloose) and his equally __amazing__ run in the first round.
