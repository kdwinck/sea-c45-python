Homework 8

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.43059987061138255

Problem 3:

Commenting the variables out creates a NameError. Linenum and Seq are no longer
defined so the error is thrown when it tries to reference the variables. If we
comment out gc_count we will also get a NameError because gc_count is no longer
defined with a value.

Problem 4:

AT-content: 0.5694001293886175

Problem 5:

G-content: 5738773
C-content: 5879128
A-content: 7701287
T-content: 7661547

Problem 6:

All files except test-small.fastq had differneces. The difference occurs
between the total_count and the (A, T, G, C) count.

The difference is a result of other elements occuring in the sequence of
nucleotides. For instance, the first element in sample_5.fastq is 'N', which is
added to the total_count but not the (A, T, G, C) count.

You should use the sum of the A, T, G, $ C counts as the denominator. Any other
variables are errors that should not be taken into consideration.

My program incorrectly computed the GC content because I was using total_count
as the denominator.

Problem 7:

AT/GC ratio: 1.3223416174746196

Problem 8:

GC Classifcation: moderate GC content

Collaboration:

I did this assingment without assistance, although I do have a co-worker
who runs a biotech company on the side who does PCR all the time and was
able to explain that in more detail to me.

Reflection:

I learned most about making sure you are using the correct data BEFORE you
run any calculations. I wish I had known there were other letterns contained
within the sequences. That would have saved me a bit of time. If I were to do
an assignment like this in the future, I hope I would calculate things more
accurately to begin with (AKA elif "T" etc. vs else). I would tell future
students to read carefully and go slowly so you don't miss anything.
